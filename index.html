                This project delves into the fascinating world of reading habits, drawing insights from a rich dataset sourced from Wikipediaâ€™s List of Lists.
                The focus is on understanding popular reading genres and the gender dynamics among authors, making it useful for anyone interested in literary trends or seeking book recommendations.
                <br><br>
                The first graph shows the top genre from each year and how many books of that genre were read in that year. The rest of the graphs provide
                a year-by-year breakdown of each genre read in that respective year and how many books of that year were read as well. 
                <br><br>
                The last two graphs present a view of the gender disparity between the male and female authors in each year and the number of each in order to give a 
                sense of authors dynamic. The following graph presents a breakdown between the male and female authors in their respective genres, again, in order to shed some 
                light into the gender breakdown of each genre.
